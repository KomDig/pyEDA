# pyEDA-pkg

This is an independent packaging of the [https://github.com/HealthSciTech/pyEDA](pyEDA) code into a Python
package better suited to be used by external Python applications wanting to make use of the pyEDA methodology
for performing training, evaluation and use of models based on the features provided by it.

It is based on the [pyEDA v.2.0](https://github.com/HealthSciTech/pyEDA) code, and took its first 
steps from the `e664ecd` commit.

See `README.md` in the `pyEDA` folder for the original information included with the source code.

## Installation

This is simplest done by running

```
pip install git+https://github.com/KomDig/pyEDA
```

or add it in your `requirements.txt`:

```
git+https://github.com/KomDig/pyEDA@main#egg=pyeda-pkg
```

## Usage
